Breast Cancer Detection using ML 

The primary objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model using logistic regression. Logistic regression is a classification algorithm that can be used to predict the probability of an instance belonging to a particular class, making it suitable for binary classification tasks like breast cancer detection (cancerous or non-cancerous).
